7 Rules for Comparing Functions Asymptotically

Rule 1

n 
k
 ∈O(n 
k+c
 ) as long as c≥0

Or, for polynomials, just compare the degrees.

Rule 2

log(n)∈O(n)

Rule 2a

log(n)∈O(n 
k
 ) for any k>0

(Including when k is a small fraction).

Rule 3

f(n)+g(n)+…+h(n)∈O(max{f(n),g(n),…,h(n)})

Or, for things added together, we only care about the worst bit.

Rule 4

Ignore constant multipliers.

Rule 5

f∈O(f)

Or, everything is in big-oh of itself.

Rule 6

n 
k
 ∈O(c 
n
 ) for any k≥0,c>1

Or, exponentials are always eventually worse than polynomials.

Rule 7

If f∈O(g) then h×f∈O(h×g) for every sensible h.

Or, we can multiply or divide by common factors, as long as we don't try anything silly (for the mathematically inclined, try to find an interesting silly case).
